    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For July 4th Eileen, Ivan, Danny and I went to Yosemite! We hiked from Mirror Lake up Snow Creek, it was no easy feat. We walked from Curry Village to Mirror Lake and following the Mirror Lake Loop trail got to the beginnings of the 2700ft elevation climb in the form of shadeless 107 switchbacks. I like to pride myself in my the abilities of my thunderous thighs, but this hike was a literal pain in the butt (for like 3 days after too). With the heat beating against our backs, our 30+ pound packs weighing down our backs, and each step breaking the backs of our spirit, we nearly drank all of our water!</p>

<p>After finally ascending the rim, we used the water from snow creek with iodine tablets for cooking water, and saved what little precious store purchased water we had left for the next day. We found a really nice pre set up camp past the footbridge (thank you previous campers!). We were good campers though and did not use the fire pit.</p>
