    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my <strong>FAVORITE</strong> parts of Taiwan was Jiu Fen (九份), which used to be a mining town up in the mountains. The name means 9 portions and comes from the fact that there used to be 9 main families and so when shipments would come to their port people would always ask for 9 portions of items, and voila! their name was born.</p>

<p>Aside from this place having absolutely amazing scenery, it&rsquo;s actually the inspiration for Spirited away!</p>

<p>I went during the day time, and my little old iPhone camera would not have been able to do the town justice anyways.</p>

<p>So here is a stolen picture off google images [HQwallpaper.com] that displays the true magnificence - and may perhaps show you just how spirited away could have been inspired by this humble town.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jiufen/jiufen_night.jpg"></p>

<p>You can read more about a lot of the similarities between spirited away and Jiu fen as well as some history at this kids <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/2013/10/01/i-went-to-the-real-life-spirited-away/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2>MORE MARKETS</h2>

<p>Jiu Fen has an &ldquo;old street&rdquo;, which is basically a market, and they serve more iconic sticky gooey goodies. My favorite was definitely this shaved ice mochi red bean concoction. I bought two that day, and bought another later in another market. I was in love.</p>

<p>Here are some picss:</p>

<p>My picture of this delectable treat was not cute, so I borrowed this one from <a href="https://areyutravelling.wordpress.com/2013/11/12/taiwan-day-16-taipei/">AreYuTravelling</a></p>

<h3>Side Story</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny because we were here during all the Chinese New Year (CNY) celebrations, and many of Thomas&#8217; relatives suggested that we not go as it would be incredibly crowded and lines for busses would be insane.</p>

<p>Well, you know how everyone believes their luck peaks during CNY? Ours certainly did. We took the MRT from Thomas&#8217; Grandma&rsquo;s house to the bus station, and when we got there, there was a short line for the bus. But as soon as we got in line, the bus arrived, and while we were starting to get on the bus, the line nearly quintupled in size! Because we were near the front we got to sit down for the 2 hour ride to Jiu Fen, but a lot of people had to stand, and a lot more people had to continue waiting in line.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/jiufen/line.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>This bus also made another stop at a city in between, and the line for the bus at that stop circled around a whole building!</p>

<p>Fast forward to leaving, at about 4pm we were ready to head back, and we mistakenly got on the wrong bus. The bus that we got on was heading further up the mountain to a parking lot. The road to that parking spot was incredibly narrow and the rate that we were moving was about 1 meter a minute. I shit you not. Any how, after having not moved for about 1 hour, I realize that we are on the wrong bus, and see the bus that we were supposed to take heading in the opposite direction of us, and as we had once again luckily gotten a seat on this bus at the back of the bus. We ask the bus driver if we may get off already traffic halted bus and board the other. He rolls down his window and asks the other bus driver if he has room, to which the other bus driver says yes. We then proceed to climb over seats and people, even climbing over a stroller (these busses were SUPER CROWDED), and manage to get on the correct bus. The traffic heading down the mountain was not as bad as going up, so as soon as we got on, we got moving. Also, everyone on the bus had been coming from the parking lot, therefore they were HEADING to the heart of Jiu Fen, so 80% of the bus got off at the stop that we were supposed to have gotten on. When they got off, we got seats, and we also witnessed possibly the longest line I have ever seen. It wounded all the way down the city of Jiu Fen. I tried to take a picture but it&rsquo;s definitey a &ldquo;YHTBT&rdquo; sort of thing. Basically it&rsquo;s the idea of taking the up elevator to catch a down elevator that isn&rsquo;t full. Thus, we had no lines, no real wait, and no standing for 4+ hours.</p>

<p>You may not think this to be that epic, as it is a story of public transportation, but you may not understand just how many Chinese tourists there were. SO SO SO MANY.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Kenting</h3>

<p>So we also made a pit stop in Kenting. According to Trip Advisor folklore, Kenting was supposed to be poppin. But Taiwan is just a little too north of the equator and it has more seasons than Thailand. Thus the Taiwan winter meant lots of big Chinese Tour Buses with lots of Chinese families, no party people, and cold beaches.</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/1.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>We actually drove by a bus crash, which looked pretty frightening!</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/crash.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>But it was still pretty and my first taste of one of those &ldquo;Taiwan Night Markets&rdquo;. Thus we ended up changing our plans and left a day early to Taipei!</p>

<h3>Tam Sui - 淡水</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s like a day market that lines a port, they literally call it Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf for the SF inclined. We got sugar cane juice, ice cream burritos, these weird tofu bricks, giant ice cream cones, these really gelationous jelly fish looking things that are basically boiled chinese bbq pork encased by rice flour. You know what, let me just show you pictures.</p>

<p>But before I do, here&rsquo;s the infamous turkish ice cream guy. I literally had a BALL just watching him. He is a true performer, and you can tell that he genuinely enjoys his job. Apologies for the vertical iPhone footage.</p>

<p>Annnd this is one of many &ldquo;American&rdquo; fashion faux pas that we witnessed. The Taiwanese love their patterns lol.</p>

<h3>Mango Shaved Ice - 芒果冰</h3>

<p>So apparently the Taiwanese are responsible for the invention Pearl Milk Tea (or as my friends and I like to call it: BubzTea). But on top of this amazingly delicious fattening drink, they are also the creators of the equally unhealthy mango shaved ice.</p>

<p>According to Thomas&#8217; uncle, there was a year where mango yield was just off the charts, so they had so much extra mango and couldn&rsquo;t sell it because market value was so low, that some farmer started selling mango shaved ice and it just took off.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, shaved ice hasn&rsquo;t particularly taken off in America. This is not your typical snow cone shaved ice, its more of a creamy fine grained texture. It might as wellnot be called ice. We went to 3 mango shaved ice places through out the trip, and each place was so different! Some of them have the mango infused with the shaved ice, some of them had a mixture of a brown sugar infused shaved ice that had thicker chunks? In any case, they were all delicious and the mangos were on point. It is interesting to see how different Taiwanese mango was from Thai mango&hellip; I gotta say I like the Taiwanese mango more hehe.</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/mango_1.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Jeremy Lin ate at the place where we got the mango shaved ice pictured below!</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/mango_2.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t seem to find the picture of the last mango shaved ice, but it was at the infamous Monster Ice, and was absolutely delicious. We also ordered a bubble milk tea flavored shaved ice, which was bomb diggity, and offered a nice contrast to the almost overly sweet mango.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Taroko Gorge is <em>Gorge</em>ous!  The view throughout is relatively the same however (sort of like how the Grand Canyon looks pretty much the same)</p>

<p>But it was still very beautiful with many sights/trails to see.</p>

<p>We went straight from the airport to the Taipei train station down to Xin Cheng where our very expensive Airbnb was located.</p>

<p>Our Airbnb hosts were amazing though. They built their Airbnb by hand themselves, and they took us everywhere. They picked us up from the train station, sent us to food, sent us to rent bikes/scooters, taught us to ride scooters, helped us buy fireworks, and made us a chicken in a tin box over a fire.</p>

<p>We were advised by our Airbnb hosts to rent a scooter and go through the gorge, we originally were going to walk. That would have taken us 3 hours which means we probably would have only been able to see a couple of the trails per day.</p>

<p>With a scooter we were basically able to knock out all of the trails from the Gorge entrance to Tian Xiang. There were a couple of trails that were closed down for construction. Taroko Gorge is known to have a lot of rock falls, you can even see a lot of the past ones that have occurred.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty straight forward park, so I&rsquo;ll just include a map and some of the pictures from the park. I really enjoyed Swallow Grotto, Tian Xiang, Baiyang Waterfall, and Sha Ka Dang trail.</p>
