    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my <strong>FAVORITE</strong> parts of Taiwan was Jiu Fen (九份), which used to be a mining town up in the mountains. The name means 9 portions and comes from the fact that there used to be 9 main families and so when shipments would come to their port people would always ask for 9 portions of items, and voila! their name was born.</p>

<p>Aside from this place having absolutely amazing scenery, it&rsquo;s actually the inspiration for Spirited away!</p>

<p>I went during the day time, and my little old iPhone camera would not have been able to do the town justice anyways.</p>

<p>So here is a stolen picture off google images [HQwallpaper.com] that displays the true magnificence - and may perhaps show you just how spirited away could have been inspired by this humble town.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jiufen/jiufen_night.jpg"></p>

<p>You can read more about a lot of the similarities between spirited away and Jiu fen as well as some history at this kids <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/2013/10/01/i-went-to-the-real-life-spirited-away/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2>MORE MARKETS</h2>

<p>Jiu Fen has an &ldquo;old street&rdquo;, which is basically a market, and they serve more iconic sticky gooey goodies. My favorite was definitely this shaved ice mochi red bean concoction. I bought two that day, and bought another later in another market. I was in love.</p>

<p>Here are some picss:</p>

<p>My picture of this delectable treat was not cute, so I borrowed this one from <a href="https://areyutravelling.wordpress.com/2013/11/12/taiwan-day-16-taipei/">AreYuTravelling</a></p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://areyutravelling.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_1801.jpg?w=700&amp;h=466">https://areyutravelling.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_1801.jpg?w=700&amp;h=466</a>&#8221; width=&#8221;600&#8221;></p>

<h3>Side Story</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny because we were here during all the Chinese New Year (CNY) celebrations, and many of Thomas&#8217; relatives suggested that we not go as it would be incredibly crowded and lines for busses would be insane.</p>

<p>Well, you know how everyone believes their luck peaks during CNY? Ours certainly did. We took the MRT from Thomas&#8217; Grandma&rsquo;s house to the bus station, and when we got there, there was a short line for the bus. But as soon as we got in line, the bus arrived, and while we were starting to get on the bus, the line nearly quintupled in size! Because we were near the front we got to sit down for the 2 hour ride to Jiu Fen, but a lot of people had to stand, and a lot more people had to continue waiting in line.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/jiufen/line.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>This bus also made another stop at a city in between, and the line for the bus at that stop circled around a whole building!</p>

<p>Fast forward to leaving, at about 4pm we were ready to head back, and we mistakenly got on the wrong bus. The bus that we got on was heading further up the mountain to a parking lot. The road to that parking spot was incredibly narrow and the rate that we were moving was about 1 meter a minute. I shit you not. Any how, after having not moved for about 1 hour, I realize that we are on the wrong bus, and see the bus that we were supposed to take heading in the opposite direction of us, and as we had once again luckily gotten a seat on this bus at the back of the bus. We ask the bus driver if we may get off already traffic halted bus and board the other. He rolls down his window and asks the other bus driver if he has room, to which the other bus driver says yes. We then proceed to climb over seats and people, even climbing over a stroller (these busses were SUPER CROWDED), and manage to get on the correct bus. The traffic heading down the mountain was not as bad as going up, so as soon as we got on, we got moving. Also, everyone on the bus had been coming from the parking lot, therefore they were HEADING to the heart of Jiu Fen, so 80% of the bus got off at the stop that we were supposed to have gotten on. When they got off, we got seats, and we also witnessed possibly the longest line I have ever seen. It wounded all the way down the city of Jiu Fen. I tried to take a picture but it&rsquo;s definitey a &ldquo;YHTBT&rdquo; sort of thing. Basically it&rsquo;s the idea of taking the up elevator to catch a down elevator that isn&rsquo;t full. Thus, we had no lines, no real wait, and no standing for 4+ hours.</p>

<p>You may not think this to be that epic, as it is a story of public transportation, but you may not understand just how many Chinese tourists there were. SO SO SO MANY.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Kenting</h3>

<p>So we also made a pit stop in Kenting. According to Trip Advisor folklore, Kenting was supposed to be poppin. But Taiwan is just a little too north of the equator and it has more seasons than Thailand. Thus the Taiwan winter meant lots of big Chinese Tour Buses with lots of Chinese families, no party people, and cold beaches.</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/1.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>We actually drove by a bus crash, which looked pretty frightening!</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/crash.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>But it was still pretty and my first taste of one of those &ldquo;Taiwan Night Markets&rdquo;. Thus we ended up changing our plans and left a day early to Taipei!</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/kenting_2.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/kenting_1.jpg" width="600"></p>

<h3>Tam Sui - 淡水</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s like a day market that lines a port, they literally call it Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf for the SF inclined. We got sugar cane juice, ice cream burritos, these weird tofu bricks, giant ice cream cones, these really gelationous jelly fish looking things that are basically boiled chinese bbq pork encased by rice flour. You know what, let me just show you pictures.</p>

<p>But before I do, here&rsquo;s the infamous turkish ice cream guy. I literally had a BALL just watching him. He is a true performer, and you can tell that he genuinely enjoys his job. Apologies for the vertical iPhone footage.</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/ds_7.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Annnd this is one of many &ldquo;American&rdquo; fashion faux pas that we witnessed. The Taiwanese love their patterns lol.</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/ffp.jpg" width="600"></p>

<h3>Mango Shaved Ice - 芒果冰</h3>

<p>So apparently the Taiwanese are responsible for the invention Pearl Milk Tea (or as my friends and I like to call it: BubzTea). But on top of this amazingly delicious fattening drink, they are also the creators of the equally unhealthy mango shaved ice.</p>

<p>According to Thomas&#8217; uncle, there was a year where mango yield was just off the charts, so they had so much extra mango and couldn&rsquo;t sell it because market value was so low, that some farmer started selling mango shaved ice and it just took off.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, shaved ice hasn&rsquo;t particularly taken off in America. This is not your typical snow cone shaved ice, its more of a creamy fine grained texture. It might as wellnot be called ice. We went to 3 mango shaved ice places through out the trip, and each place was so different! Some of them have the mango infused with the shaved ice, some of them had a mixture of a brown sugar infused shaved ice that had thicker chunks? In any case, they were all delicious and the mangos were on point. It is interesting to see how different Taiwanese mango was from Thai mango&hellip; I gotta say I like the Taiwanese mango more hehe.</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/mango_1.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Jeremy Lin ate at the place where we got the mango shaved ice pictured below!</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/mango_2.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t seem to find the picture of the last mango shaved ice, but it was at the infamous Monster Ice, and was absolutely delicious. We also ordered a bubble milk tea flavored shaved ice, which was bomb diggity, and offered a nice contrast to the almost overly sweet mango.</p>

    <link href="http://loonyuni.com/blog/2015/02/27/taroko-gorge/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-27T20:04:01-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://loonyuni.com/blog/2015/02/27/taroko-gorge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Taroko Gorge is <em>Gorge</em>ous!  The view throughout is relatively the same however (sort of like how the Grand Canyon looks pretty much the same)</p>

<p>But it was still very beautiful with many sights/trails to see.</p>

<p>We went straight from the airport to the Taipei train station down to Xin Cheng where our very expensive Airbnb was located.</p>

<p>Our Airbnb hosts were amazing though. They built their Airbnb by hand themselves, and they took us everywhere. They picked us up from the train station, sent us to food, sent us to rent bikes/scooters, taught us to ride scooters, helped us buy fireworks, and made us a chicken in a tin box over a fire.</p>

<p>We were advised by our Airbnb hosts to rent a scooter and go through the gorge, we originally were going to walk. That would have taken us 3 hours which means we probably would have only been able to see a couple of the trails per day.</p>

<p>With a scooter we were basically able to knock out all of the trails from the Gorge entrance to Tian Xiang. There were a couple of trails that were closed down for construction. Taroko Gorge is known to have a lot of rock falls, you can even see a lot of the past ones that have occurred.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty straight forward park, so I&rsquo;ll just include a map and some of the pictures from the park. I really enjoyed Swallow Grotto, Tian Xiang, Baiyang Waterfall, and Sha Ka Dang trail.</p>

    <link href="http://loonyuni.com/blog/2015/02/14/chiang-mai/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-14T07:19:11-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://loonyuni.com/blog/2015/02/14/chiang-mai</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>YAY CHIANG MAI!</h2>

<p>In Chiang Mai we met up with Eileen and Ivan &lt;3 !</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/tuktuk_together.jpg" width="550"></p>

<p>The first night we went into Old Chiang Mai, and the flower festival happened to be going on! It apparently only occurs like 3 times in February, so we were quite lucky!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/flower_fest.JPG"></p>

<p>We then to visit the Sunday Market which is right behind Tapthae Gate. It was a lively market, with lots of food, similar to the many other night markets we had visited previously. <strong>BUT</strong>, everything was much cheaper. The selection may have been smaller, but if you are looking for any of those famous &ldquo;Thai Tourist&rdquo; pants/shorts or some pashminas, wait until you get to Chiang Mai before purchasing.</p>

<p>We also all got 1 hour Thai Massages for 180 Baht, which is an insane deal. And it felt <em>sooo</em> good. Eileen said these massages were far better than the ones she experienced in Cambodia.</p>

<h2>Skyline Adventures</h2>

<p>The next day we signed up for a Skyline Adventures package where you pay 1,800 baht per person, and they pick you up from the hotel and take you on adventures lol.</p>

<h3>Elephants</h3>

<p>First the bus took us to ride elephants. I know, I know, riding elephants is bad. And we saw them use the bow hook tool to hit the elephants as well as tug on their ear to direct them. Eileen and Ivan also went to an elephant conservatory in Cambodia, and Thomas and I also read online a lot of the horrors that come along with elephant/tiger exhibition. But it was part of the package deal and we decided to just do it :/.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/elephantear.jpg" width="550"></p>

<p>Anyways, we got to see one of the elephants poo in the river, and these majestic creatures have equally majestic excrements. They were the size of bowling  balls, and they just kept going! As we were traversing the river, our elephant decided to suck in some mixture of water and sand to spray upon itself to cool itself down. However, we were riding upon said elephant, so Thomas and I got sprayed with these small rocks and water. It was surprising, hilarious, and a little gross. Thomas had this big piece of elephant snot on his cheek lol.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/booger.jpg" width="550"></p>

<p>Side note, they were using a car battery to power a printer for pictures! How cool is that</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/printer_car.JPG" width="550"></p>

<h3>Bamboo Rafting</h3>

<p>This was awesome! It&rsquo;s exactly what it sounds like, but the river they take you around is so peaceful and beautiful. We also had really playful tour guides who managed to get us all soaking wet, and a very funny mishap happened with Thomas where the guide jumped over a tree branch and convinced Thomas to do the same when you were in fact supposed to go under the branch. What ensued was a confused Thomas falling into the river as the bamboo raft glided away.</p>

<p>It was sort of like extreme scenic paddleboarding.</p>

<h3>Ziplining</h3>

<p>Ziplining in the states is about $120. If we were to say that each of these activities (there being a total of 3) were given the same cost, then that would mean ziplining in Thailand is about $20 per person. That&rsquo;s INSANE.</p>

<p>There were a total of 19 different platforms. Some of them were sort of &ldquo;ropes course&rdquo; like, while the majority were ziplining from platform to platform.</p>

<p>One of the final ziplines was SUPER long, not sure how many meters it was but the view was amazing! We also had the option of doing the zipline &ldquo;Superman Style&rdquo; for this one, where instead of being harnessed in the front at your waist, you were harnessed on your back between your shoulder blades, allowing you to &ldquo;fly&rdquo; like superman! So much fun!!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXuuH8ZORTI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>We then went to get some more massages, this time I tried an oil massage. It was what you imagine when you think massage, and definitely relaxing. But I definitely prefer the traditional Thai Massage.</p>

<h3>Bar Scene!</h3>

<p>We went to the Bars (just look up <strong>Zoe in Yellow</strong>), and we got it poppin! The DJ&rsquo;s were hella good, and we danced our asses off! The drinks are more expensive, but they&rsquo;re still cheaper than SF drinks ;).</p>

<h3>Nong Buak Park</h3>

<p>In the south west corner of old Chiang Mai, there is this park. Which is very cute! We bought a huge bag of fish/bird feed? for 10 Baht. And we killed 2 hours there luring pigeons in and then scaring them. Thomas even managed to catch a bird with his feet!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice park, and there were many people having picnics and sunbathing near the pond.</p>

<h3>Thai Cooking Class</h3>

<p>Dude!! These are amazing. Small somewhat of a digression; even as an ethnically Chinese person, when I walk into a 99 Ranch, I have no idea how to use 90% of the things in that store. The 10% I do know is from what little I have picked up from watching my parents. But the same goes for trying to cook Thai food. Without knowledge of what ingredients to buy, and what they look like, or what they&rsquo;re called, you can&rsquo;t really cook authentically!</p>

<p>We learned everything needed to cook most Thai dishes, and even made our own curry paste! It was very fun, and you definitely learn a lot. They also give you a recipe book and a little certificate saying you completed the course lol. I cannot wait to cook Thai food at home! :)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/apron.JPG" width="550"></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/fire.JPG" width="550"></p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/group_cook.jpg" width="550"></p>

<h3>Doi Suthep</h3>

<p>This is a temple at one of the highest points in Chiang Mai, and everyone told us that you have not visited Chiang Mai until you&rsquo;ve visited Doi Suthep. On top of climbing a mountain by taxi to get there, you have to climb 306 steps (which really wasn&rsquo;t that bad at all..) to get to &ldquo;360&rdquo; panoramic views of Chiang Mai.</p>

<p>There was so much construction going on at Doi Suthep, as well as foggy weather, that we were deprived of the promised views. The temple was indeed pretty however, but overall, it was too similar to the many many temples we had already visited before.</p>

<h3>Monk Chats</h3>

<p>A really cool thing that Chiang Mai has is Monk Chats. At almost every temple, there is a time in the day where many young monks will sit at tables and conversate with you about Bhuddism and Monk Life. They spend about 3 hours a week learning English, and this is part of their practice.</p>

<p>We went to Wat ChediLuang and talked to a couple of monks, and during the process we met three &ldquo;missionaries&rdquo;, they&rsquo;re not allowed to say they&rsquo;re missionaries in Thailand or something. But it was really cool learning about what they were doing! They had already spent 3 months in Guatemala, and 2 months in Thailand. They were heading to South Africa next, and were big fans of the cheap tattoos in Thailand haha.
We also talked to one monk who&rsquo;s english was more proficient, and he explained to us the journey of becoming a monk. From 7-20 years old they are novice, and after that they have the option of becoming &ldquo;Monk&rdquo; if they believe they are ready.</p>

<p>They also have extensive schooling where they attend the same schools as the other Thai students, but they have designated &ldquo;Monk&rdquo; tracks. I won&rsquo;t keep going, and let you learn for yourself when you talk to them! :)</p>

    <link href="http://loonyuni.com/blog/2015/02/14/phuket/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-14T07:19:03-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://loonyuni.com/blog/2015/02/14/phuket</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So&hellip; we got robbed. Not sure when, where, or how. Thomas&#8217; guess is the hostel where about 20 people shared a room, and it was basically a free for all during the Full Moon Party or when everyone was asleep. My guess is there was someone going through our belongings on the bus from Surat Thani to Phuket.</p>

<p>Baiscally, we both thought we were clever, and surreptitiously stashed about $300 in our socks, glasses case, retainer boxes.. etc. ALL GONE. And, we&rsquo;re carrying giant backpacking backpacks, so our stuff isn&rsquo;t on the surface, this stuff is lodged in the abyss of mushed items in our bag.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Don&rsquo;t bring much cash with you, and just use the ATM, or just make sure you bring it with you at all times (and don&rsquo;t get pickpocketed)</p>

<p>Anyways.</p>

<p>Because of this recent loss of money, we tried to be very cheap in Phuket, and therefore didn&rsquo;t do much.</p>

<p>We stayed in D&rsquo;s Corner and Guestroom which we found on Airbnb, though she was an AMAZING host, I recommend staying IN Patong, as Phuket is very expensive having been overrun with old tourists with money.</p>

<h2>Patong</h2>

<p>Here was where we had intended to go jet skiing, but again, due to money issues, we decided not to.</p>

<p>The beach was really nice though! Warm calm waters, as the beach is more in a bay. The bad thing about this beach however is that it is extremely touristy. It&rsquo;s impossible to just chill on the beach, as every 3-5 minutes someone is coming up to you, trying to sell you parasailing, jet skiing, juice, beer, mats, necklaces, sunglasses&hellip; you get the point.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i.imgur.com/NXtwoB6.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/NXtwoB6.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>We then walked around Patong, and eventually found a really cheap fish spa thing. I&rsquo;m sure you have all heard or seen one of these before, they have these little fish, which I&rsquo;m sure they starve (we saw one fish eating another dead fellow fish at one spa) that will come and supposedly suck the dead skin off your feet. It was only 100 Baht for 30 minutes, so we decided to try it. It was <strong>SO TICKLISH</strong>. I don&rsquo;t think I had much dead skin hanging off my feet, so I couldn&rsquo;t tell much of a difference, but my skin did feel raw which I&rsquo;m sure 30 minutes of sucking will do to you.</p>

<h3>Boxing</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i.imgur.com/XBdW74q.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/XBdW74q.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>Aside from Lumpini Boxing Stadium in Bangkok, we heard the next best thing was the Patong Boxing. So we paid 1,300 Baht each to watch some boxing.</p>

<p>There were a total of 8 matches, the first 4 were between kids. Like 14 year old boys. It was weird to watch.</p>

<p>The 5th match was two girls! Pretty cool. We saw 2 K.O.&rsquo;s and there were a lot of people gambling (a part of me thinks it was rigged but whatever)</p>

<p>It was cool to see, you get to witness a lot of the culture involved. From the tradition of dancing to honor the sport before each match to the synchronized &ldquo;EYY&rdquo;&rsquo;s and &ldquo;OOOH&rdquo;&rsquo;s from the crowd with each successful hit. (And also the music and gambling) But at the end of the day it&rsquo;s really hit or miss on who the fighers are, I guess if you have more knowledge on the local fighters than you would know who to watch, but we just went because it was convenient, and the fights were so-so.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i.imgur.com/GaThwlg.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/GaThwlg.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>I think watching boxing on television is fun, but I think seeing it in person, watching one person hurt another live was kind of hard to watch.</p>

<p>Thomas also got a bomb ass haircut for $5. Complete with a nice fade and they even handled his wacky cowlick!</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i.imgur.com/has6W0u.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/has6W0u.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<h3>Phuket Day 2</h3>

<p>The next day we basically just wasted until we got on our flight to Bangkok, where we would then take a train to Chiang Mai. Which was FAR more fun.</p>

<p>Although we did enjoy this Thai Iced Tea, and a lot of guava shakes.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i.imgur.com/C6OxDGn.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/C6OxDGn.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>
