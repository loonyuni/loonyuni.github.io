  <p>For July 4th Eileen, Ivan, Danny and I went to Yosemite! We hiked from Mirror Lake up Snow Creek, it was no easy feat. We walked from Curry Village to Mirror Lake and following the Mirror Lake Loop trail got to the beginnings of the 2700ft elevation climb in the form of shadeless 107 switchbacks. I like to pride myself in my the abilities of my thunderous thighs, but this hike was a literal pain in the butt (for like 3 days after too). With the heat beating against our backs, our 30+ pound packs weighing down our backs, and each step breaking the backs of our spirit, we nearly drank all of our water!</p>

<p>After finally ascending the rim, we used the water from snow creek with iodine tablets for cooking water, and saved what little precious store purchased water we had left for the next day. We found a really nice pre set up camp past the footbridge (thank you previous campers!). We were good campers though and did not use the fire pit.</p>

  <p>One of my <strong>FAVORITE</strong> parts of Taiwan was Jiu Fen (九份), which used to be a mining town up in the mountains. The name means 9 portions and comes from the fact that there used to be 9 main families and so when shipments would come to their port people would always ask for 9 portions of items, and voila! their name was born.</p>

<p>Aside from this place having absolutely amazing scenery, it&rsquo;s actually the inspiration for Spirited away!</p>

<p>I went during the day time, and my little old iPhone camera would not have been able to do the town justice anyways.</p>

<p>So here is a stolen picture off google images [HQwallpaper.com] that displays the true magnificence - and may perhaps show you just how spirited away could have been inspired by this humble town.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jiufen/jiufen_night.jpg"></p>

<p>You can read more about a lot of the similarities between spirited away and Jiu fen as well as some history at this kids <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/2013/10/01/i-went-to-the-real-life-spirited-away/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2>MORE MARKETS</h2>

<p>Jiu Fen has an &ldquo;old street&rdquo;, which is basically a market, and they serve more iconic sticky gooey goodies. My favorite was definitely this shaved ice mochi red bean concoction. I bought two that day, and bought another later in another market. I was in love.</p>

<p>Here are some picss:</p>

<p>My picture of this delectable treat was not cute, so I borrowed this one from <a href="https://areyutravelling.wordpress.com/2013/11/12/taiwan-day-16-taipei/">AreYuTravelling</a></p>

  <h3>Kenting</h3>

<p>So we also made a pit stop in Kenting. According to Trip Advisor folklore, Kenting was supposed to be poppin. But Taiwan is just a little too north of the equator and it has more seasons than Thailand. Thus the Taiwan winter meant lots of big Chinese Tour Buses with lots of Chinese families, no party people, and cold beaches.</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/1.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>We actually drove by a bus crash, which looked pretty frightening!</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/crash.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>But it was still pretty and my first taste of one of those &ldquo;Taiwan Night Markets&rdquo;. Thus we ended up changing our plans and left a day early to Taipei!</p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/kenting_2.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p><img src="/images/danshui_mango/kenting_1.jpg" width="600"></p>

<h3>Tam Sui - 淡水</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s like a day market that lines a port, they literally call it Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf for the SF inclined. We got sugar cane juice, ice cream burritos, these weird tofu bricks, giant ice cream cones, these really gelationous jelly fish looking things that are basically boiled chinese bbq pork encased by rice flour. You know what, let me just show you pictures.</p>

<p>But before I do, here&rsquo;s the infamous turkish ice cream guy. I literally had a BALL just watching him. He is a true performer, and you can tell that he genuinely enjoys his job. Apologies for the vertical iPhone footage.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>Taroko Gorge is <em>Gorge</em>ous!  The view throughout is relatively the same however (sort of like how the Grand Canyon looks pretty much the same)</p>

<p>But it was still very beautiful with many sights/trails to see.</p>

<p>We went straight from the airport to the Taipei train station down to Xin Cheng where our very expensive Airbnb was located.</p>

<p>Our Airbnb hosts were amazing though. They built their Airbnb by hand themselves, and they took us everywhere. They picked us up from the train station, sent us to food, sent us to rent bikes/scooters, taught us to ride scooters, helped us buy fireworks, and made us a chicken in a tin box over a fire.</p>

<p>We were advised by our Airbnb hosts to rent a scooter and go through the gorge, we originally were going to walk. That would have taken us 3 hours which means we probably would have only been able to see a couple of the trails per day.</p>

<p>With a scooter we were basically able to knock out all of the trails from the Gorge entrance to Tian Xiang. There were a couple of trails that were closed down for construction. Taroko Gorge is known to have a lot of rock falls, you can even see a lot of the past ones that have occurred.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty straight forward park, so I&rsquo;ll just include a map and some of the pictures from the park. I really enjoyed Swallow Grotto, Tian Xiang, Baiyang Waterfall, and Sha Ka Dang trail.</p>

  <h2>YAY CHIANG MAI!</h2>

<p>In Chiang Mai we met up with Eileen and Ivan &lt;3 !</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/tuktuk_together.jpg" width="550"></p>

<p>The first night we went into Old Chiang Mai, and the flower festival happened to be going on! It apparently only occurs like 3 times in February, so we were quite lucky!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/flower_fest.JPG"></p>

<p>We then to visit the Sunday Market which is right behind Tapthae Gate. It was a lively market, with lots of food, similar to the many other night markets we had visited previously. <strong>BUT</strong>, everything was much cheaper. The selection may have been smaller, but if you are looking for any of those famous &ldquo;Thai Tourist&rdquo; pants/shorts or some pashminas, wait until you get to Chiang Mai before purchasing.</p>

<p>We also all got 1 hour Thai Massages for 180 Baht, which is an insane deal. And it felt <em>sooo</em> good. Eileen said these massages were far better than the ones she experienced in Cambodia.</p>

<h2>Skyline Adventures</h2>

<p>The next day we signed up for a Skyline Adventures package where you pay 1,800 baht per person, and they pick you up from the hotel and take you on adventures lol.</p>

<h3>Elephants</h3>

<p>First the bus took us to ride elephants. I know, I know, riding elephants is bad. And we saw them use the bow hook tool to hit the elephants as well as tug on their ear to direct them. Eileen and Ivan also went to an elephant conservatory in Cambodia, and Thomas and I also read online a lot of the horrors that come along with elephant/tiger exhibition. But it was part of the package deal and we decided to just do it :/.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/elephantear.jpg" width="550"></p>

<p>Anyways, we got to see one of the elephants poo in the river, and these majestic creatures have equally majestic excrements. They were the size of bowling  balls, and they just kept going! As we were traversing the river, our elephant decided to suck in some mixture of water and sand to spray upon itself to cool itself down. However, we were riding upon said elephant, so Thomas and I got sprayed with these small rocks and water. It was surprising, hilarious, and a little gross. Thomas had this big piece of elephant snot on his cheek lol.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/booger.jpg" width="550"></p>

<p>Side note, they were using a car battery to power a printer for pictures! How cool is that</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/printer_car.JPG" width="550"></p>

<h3>Bamboo Rafting</h3>

<p>This was awesome! It&rsquo;s exactly what it sounds like, but the river they take you around is so peaceful and beautiful. We also had really playful tour guides who managed to get us all soaking wet, and a very funny mishap happened with Thomas where the guide jumped over a tree branch and convinced Thomas to do the same when you were in fact supposed to go under the branch. What ensued was a confused Thomas falling into the river as the bamboo raft glided away.</p>

<p>It was sort of like extreme scenic paddleboarding.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>So&hellip; we got robbed. Not sure when, where, or how. Thomas&#8217; guess is the hostel where about 20 people shared a room, and it was basically a free for all during the Full Moon Party or when everyone was asleep. My guess is there was someone going through our belongings on the bus from Surat Thani to Phuket.</p>

<p>Baiscally, we both thought we were clever, and surreptitiously stashed about $300 in our socks, glasses case, retainer boxes.. etc. ALL GONE. And, we&rsquo;re carrying giant backpacking backpacks, so our stuff isn&rsquo;t on the surface, this stuff is lodged in the abyss of mushed items in our bag.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Don&rsquo;t bring much cash with you, and just use the ATM, or just make sure you bring it with you at all times (and don&rsquo;t get pickpocketed)</p>

<p>Anyways.</p>

<p>Because of this recent loss of money, we tried to be very cheap in Phuket, and therefore didn&rsquo;t do much.</p>

<p>We stayed in D&rsquo;s Corner and Guestroom which we found on Airbnb, though she was an AMAZING host, I recommend staying IN Patong, as Phuket is very expensive having been overrun with old tourists with money.</p>

<h2>Patong</h2>

<p>Here was where we had intended to go jet skiing, but again, due to money issues, we decided not to.</p>

<p>The beach was really nice though! Warm calm waters, as the beach is more in a bay. The bad thing about this beach however is that it is extremely touristy. It&rsquo;s impossible to just chill on the beach, as every 3-5 minutes someone is coming up to you, trying to sell you parasailing, jet skiing, juice, beer, mats, necklaces, sunglasses&hellip; you get the point.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NXtwoB6.jpg"></p>

<p>We then walked around Patong, and eventually found a really cheap fish spa thing. I&rsquo;m sure you have all heard or seen one of these before, they have these little fish, which I&rsquo;m sure they starve (we saw one fish eating another dead fellow fish at one spa) that will come and supposedly suck the dead skin off your feet. It was only 100 Baht for 30 minutes, so we decided to try it. It was <strong>SO TICKLISH</strong>. I don&rsquo;t think I had much dead skin hanging off my feet, so I couldn&rsquo;t tell much of a difference, but my skin did feel raw which I&rsquo;m sure 30 minutes of sucking will do to you.</p>

  <p>We took a bus from Surat Thani to Donsak and then a ferry from Donsak to Koh Phangan. (I also suggest you buy everything as a package deal from Hualamphong Station or other travel agencies). We tried planning ahead for too many things, and it may have bit us in the butt, as we ended up paying for each leg of the trip individually.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nXv5z0W.jpg"></p>

<p>We stayed at Bed n&#8217; Bar right next to Haadrin Beach. I definitely recommend you look for a hostel right near the beach if you plan on attending Full Moon Party (FMP). And also suggest you try to book in advance as the rooms fill up quickly. Using Hostel World should be pretty sufficient.</p>

<p>We made quite a few new friends from the hostel, there&rsquo;s Ruben, Tomas, Maya, and Sigort. Ruben is from Portugal, Tomas from the Czech Republic, and Maya and Sigort from Denmark. We mainly hung out on the beaches and walked around the shops near Haadrin Beach until the second night, when FMP occurred.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EOjP9b3.jpg"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s insane. Everyone gets painted in neon paint, and is decked out in flower head wreaths and neon tanks.</p>

<p>Some designs you can get painted on you:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LgPCTgR.jpg" width="700"></p>

<p>The entire beach was covered with human beings. Everyone wasted drunk from sketchy vodka buckets. By 3 AM everyone seemed to be making out with someone. I have many videos, but you can do a quick google images search to see just how crazy this party is. The party kept going on all the way until 9 AM. There were people from all over the world (mainly europe), and of all ages. We saw an old man pull out coke and another old man yell &ldquo; YOU CHEEKY BASTARD! &rdquo;. There was mushroom mountain, and there were ropes of fire. An epic party to say the least.</p>

  <p>An update on our &ldquo;illnesses&rdquo;, we proceeded henceforth to eat plenty of yogurt each day and tried our best to eat more fiber. We believe that the initial cause for intestinal unrest was due to this weird porridge we had decided to try the morning of day 2. We hanve since then been much more consistent in our daily BM&rsquo;s. lol. Bring probiotic pills friends.</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<p>There really isn&rsquo;t that much to do in Bangkok, and with the pollution, it makes it somewhat uncomfortable to breathe. I heard that this is standard across most Asian cities though.</p>

<p>We started Day 3 off by going to JJ Market which is only open on weekends, and it was a blast! It&rsquo;s like MBK on steroids and outdoors. There are alleyways and endless opportunities to buy insanely cheap goods, and also counterfeit designer thingamajigs.</p>

<p>I bought myself a pair of fake white Birkenstocks, which later get stolen at a hostel. They were of terrible quality, and I hope that the loss of these short live $8 Birkenstocks was a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>Thomas bought 3 pairs of uniqlo type shorts for 300 baht, a 69 baht belt, and a bunch of socks. We also ate lots of food at the market, and saw some cool street food tricks. Unfortunately, I will not upload these videos right now.</p>

  <h2>Day Two</h2>

<p>This day is not nearly as exciting. Thomas and I on top of still being jet lagged both came down with uhh.. GI issues. It&rsquo;s amazing how much spontaneous fluids exiting your body can really ruin an outing. We both had some diarrhea issues, and I just got my period. Thomas on the other hand, felt like he was going to vomit. Just, not a good combination.</p>

<h4>TaoLin Chan Floating Market</h4>

We bussed all the way here, only to find that it was closed contrary to what all the websites said :(. We almost got scammed from a laady trying to get us to take a boat, but argued and then ran away from the angry thai lady. We met other fellow wanderers who made the same mistake, we ultimately decided to bus back and check out Central World and EatThai at the bottom floor of Central Embassy. Central World was again, super high end stuff, but nice to see. The Eatthai food court was really cool, it had little stations, each representing a region of Thailand. We tried two fried rice dishes from Northern Thailand, a Curry dish from Southern Thailand, and some coconut shaved ice as well as a watermelon slushie.</p>

<p>Because of our &ldquo;illness&rdquo;, we then went back to our hostel/hotel and accidentally napped for 3 hours. oops.</p>

  <h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to say sorry that the only pictures we seem to have are selfies, a lot of the go pro pictures didn&rsquo;t turn out well, BUT we have hella videos, they just take ages to upload, so I&rsquo;ll do that after the trip. And I&rsquo;d also like to apologize for just how word vomitty these posts are. They&rsquo;re very much, we did this, then this, and then that, then some of this and then that. Too tired to write well!</p>

<h2>Day One</h2>

<h4>Grand Palace</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pyiOHNq.jpg"></p>

<p>The entry fee was 500 Baht!! It was pretty, but not worth 500. I&rsquo;d say go to Wat Arun and just pay 50 Baht for their fee or go to the the National Museum right next door for also less baht and more knowledge, as it is a museum and not just pretty buildings.
There was a long road littered with stands; herb stands, food stands, keychain stands, etc. This road connected you from the Grand Palace to the neighboring National Museum and one of the best Universities in Thailand, Chulangkorn University. At this point we were extremely jet lagged, and had spent quite some baht cabbing to the Grand Palace. We decided to check in to our AirBnb.</p>

<h4>Lee Travel Inn</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IspQVaO.jpg"></p>

<p>We totally made a mistake in planning (almost) everything. Prices seem a lot cheaper here than on AirBnb, but I guess planning allows us for peace of mind, and regardless everything is pretty cheap. We like this place! However we chose a room with no A/C, just a fan, which means we&rsquo;ve been sleeping with as little clothing as possible. Luckily there seem to be no mosquitos in this fine establishment, so we&rsquo;re good. It&rsquo;s very clean, and sort of hostel-y, everyone has their own independent rooms, and there are shared bathrooms and showers. We have our own shower/bathroom which is nice. The shower water is not heated, but that&rsquo;s no big deal, and flushing is done manually. Furthermore, <strong><em>*Bring Toilet Paper!!</em></strong> everywhere you go, this place doesn&rsquo;t have any, and so do a lot of public restrooms. Wifi is only available in the lobby, which is sort of nice, you get to meet other people this way.</p>
