So... we got robbed. Not sure when, where, or how. Thomas' guess is the hostel where about 20 people shared a room, and it was basically a free for all during the Full Moon Party or when everyone was asleep. My guess is there was someone going through our belongings on the bus from Surat Thani to Phuket. 

Baiscally, we both thought we were clever, and surreptitiously stashed about $300 in our socks, glasses case, retainer boxes.. etc. ALL GONE. And, we're carrying giant backpacking backpacks, so our stuff isn't on the surface, this stuff is lodged in the abyss of mushed items in our bag. 

**Lesson Learned:** Don't bring much cash with you, and just use the ATM, or just make sure you bring it with you at all times (and don't get pickpocketed)


Anyways.

Because of this recent loss of money, we tried to be very cheap in Phuket, and therefore didn't do much. 

We stayed in D's Corner and Guestroom which we found on Airbnb, though she was an AMAZING host, I recommend staying IN Patong, as Phuket is very expensive having been overrun with old tourists with money. 

## Patong

Here was where we had intended to go jet skiing, but again, due to money issues, we decided not to. 

The beach was really nice though! Warm calm waters, as the beach is more in a bay. The bad thing about this beach however is that it is extremely touristy. It's impossible to just chill on the beach, as every 3-5 minutes someone is coming up to you, trying to sell you parasailing, jet skiing, juice, beer, mats, necklaces, sunglasses... you get the point.

We then walked around Patong, and eventually found a really cheap fish spa thing. I'm sure you have all heard or seen one of these before, they have these little fish, which I'm sure they starve (we saw one fish eating another dead fellow fish at one spa) that will come and supposedly suck the dead skin off your feet. It was only 100 Baht for 30 minutes, so we decided to try it. It was **SO TICKLISH**. I don't think I had much dead skin hanging off my feet, so I couldn't tell much of a difference, but my skin did feel raw which I'm sure 30 minutes of sucking will do to you.

### Boxing

Aside from Lumpini Boxing Stadium in Bangkok, we heard the next best thing was the Patong Boxing. So we paid 1,300 Baht each to watch some boxing. 

There were a total of 8 matches, the first 4 were between kids. Like 14 year old boys. It was weird to watch. 

The 5th match was two girls! Pretty cool. We saw 2 K.O.'s and there were a lot of people gambling (a part of me thinks it was rigged but whatever)

It was cool to see, you get to witness a lot of the culture involved. From the tradition of dancing to honor the sport before each match to the synchronized "EYY"'s and "OOOH"'s from the crowd with each successful hit. (And also the music and gambling) But at the end of the day it's really hit or miss on who the fighers are, I guess if you have more knowledge on the local fighters than you would know who to watch, but we just went because it was convenient, and the fights were so-so.

I think watching boxing on television is fun, but I think seeing it in person, watching one person hurt another live was kind of hard to watch. 

Thomas also got a bomb ass haircut for $5. Complete with a nice fade and they even handled his wacky cowlick!

### Phuket Day 2

The next day we basically just wasted until we got on our flight to Bangkok, where we would then take a train to Chiang Mai. Which was FAR more fun. 

Although we did enjoy this Thai Iced Tea, and a lot of guava shakes.
