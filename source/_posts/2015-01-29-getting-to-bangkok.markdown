## On the Plane

I finished gone girl. Even though I had read through the Wikipedia entries for both the novel and the film, I was entraced. (Like a mosquito flying with UV light in sight) It's been a while since I've read a book - almost a year actually haha. It's such a great feeling when you're immersed in a good book and half of you wants to read slowly; absorbing the metaphors that test your imagination and witty prose that makes you feel sharp, whilst the other half wishes you could read 600 wpm because the plot is so thick with excitement. I struggled between the two and often found myself impatient, skipping and reading every other paragraph near the end only to feel guilty as well as confused and go back to re-read correctly. After finishing, all I could do was think about wanting to watch the movie.

I started "Bossypants" by Tina fey and listened to a bit of "Yes, Please!"" from Amy Poehler but after Gone Girl their sarcastic memoirs seemed superficial. I know them to be not, these bombastic besties are buzzfeed/tumblr idols of mine but alas I did the opposite of what they probably would do. Gorge myself on airplane food. No, I was not hungry at all at any point on this journey, however my curiosity is stronger than the seam of my high waisted skinny jeans I decided to dawn on my 22 hour transportation fiasco, I don't know the definition of "traveling comfortably".

All the flights went smoothly, and I was finally reunited with Thomas in Japan. We meandered like fools, looking at every flavor of kit kat bar, and finding all the similarities between Daiso and the real deal. On our flight from Narita to Bangkok we watched Life is Beautiful, it takes some getting used to at first, but once you're in, you're in. A comical yet very poignant movie that follows a life of a vivacious Italian Jew during the times of World War II.

## In Thailand

We made it! But we've already been scammed. Our taxi from the airport, charged us per person... so our fee on the meter said 75 bhat (this is was also after he drove us to the wrong place and we henceforth decided to just walk instead). He charged us 150 bhat. Sure this translates to about 5 dollars, but I am a very broke person right now. We finally get to our hotel which we're only staying in for one night as we thought it'd be easiest to deal with because of our late flight. The hotel had a 4 star rating on Kayak, but idk. We walked in and our room is like a haven for mosquitos. There is this fun little master trap thing that's supposed to zap em, but it's not doing the best job possible.

Tomorrow is going to be a touristy day, visiting the Grand Palace and National Museum. I hope it will be filled with lots of walking and pad thai. We have also only learned one phrase in Thai, and that is "pom pae thaw li sung" (only phonetically spelled) which means "I am allergic to peanuts". This is because Thomas is allergic to almost every nut, Thailand should be fun. Oh -  and yes, we bought a [selfie stick](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/selfie_stick) -  we're still trying to figure out how to use it.
