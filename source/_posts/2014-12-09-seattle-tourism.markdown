2 summers ago one of my BFF's Eileen came and visited me in Seattle! So I put together this excel sheet! I still feel like a tourist in The Sound (the equivalent of calling SF area The Bay), so these are just what I do with visiting friends, so if you ever find yourself lucky enough to be in the amazing PNW, these are my suggestions on things to do! 

Also, go in the Summer if you can, it's 9 months of overcast and light precipitation, but 3 months of heaven in the Summer.

And here's the Google Drive spreadsheet, let me know if you want to edit the file!
